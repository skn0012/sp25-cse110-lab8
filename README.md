<br> How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
<br> Graceful degradation and service workers are closely related because service workers provide a way to support graceful fallback behavior when some browser features and network conditions are unavailable. Graceful degradation allows websites to remain function while some features are not working. Service workers help achieve this through intercepting network requests and serving cached content when users are having network issues. This allows previously accessed data to remain accessible.
